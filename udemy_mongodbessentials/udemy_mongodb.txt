## Documents vs Collections

Document: a record i a MongoDB collection and the basic unit of data in MongoDB. Documents look like JSON objects but exit as BSON.
BSON hasd quotes in both keys and properties

Collection: a grouping of MongoDB docs. Typically, all docs in a coll. have a related purpose

## Commands

JSON: Javascript Object notation, passed around between view and server.
db.<collectionname>.find() find docs in collection
db.<collectionname>.find().pretty() displays in easy-to-read format

Run MongoDB daemon by typing 'mongod'
Then, use MongoDB shell by typing 'mongo'

use <databasename> | creates/switches to a database
db.createCollection("<collectionname>") | creates new collection
show collections | shows collections in database

db.<collectionname>.insert({"<key>": "<property>"}); | inserts a new document
*once this document is submitted to the database, it is converted into BSON*
